# BRG Packaging

This adds a way to easily create default packages / dependencies and use them when creating new projects. After all, no one likes to copy/paste their normal list of dependencies.

## Commands

### Create New Package

This creates a new "package.json" file at the current location. Uses the default package file as the template. 

Takes in no parameters.

### Update Package Dependencies



### Save Default Package



### Create Webpack File

This creates a new "webpack.config.js" file at the current location. Uses the default webpack file as the template. 

Takes in no parameters.

### Set Default Webpack File

This sets the default webpack file contents to be the contents of another file. 

Arguements: 

* --file: this is the file to use as the new default webpack template (optional, default is 'webpack.config.js')
